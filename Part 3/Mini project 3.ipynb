It had to be brought together, he added, saying action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey. Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.\\n \\n But there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by \\\"military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values\\\" he added. Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most \\\"pressing political challenge\\\" of the present day, Mr Blair warned. The prime minister also urged Europe and the US to \\\"build anew their alliance\\\".\\n \\n \\\"All of us in positions of leadership, not just President Bush, have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. It is urgent that we do so.\\\" Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election \\\"a true celebration of American democracy\\\". The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added. Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his \\\"warmest congratulations\\\", saying: \\\"We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom.\\\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000.\\n \\n Mr Bush's first task was to \\\"rebuild a sense of domestic purpose\\\" within the US, he said. Mr Kennedy said: \\\"Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism.\\\" Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an \\\"umbilical cord\\\" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.\\n \\n \\\"Europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character, and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security. \\\"Iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come.\\\" Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.\\n \\n Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday. Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite George Bush's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. Public opinion would force change, she told BBC news. But Myron Ebell, an adviser on climate change to President Bush, has said there would be no change in the US stance and rejected the threat of climate change. He claimed the US was the only country with independent scientists.\\n\",\n          \"China Aviation seeks rescue deal\\n \\n Scandal-hit jet fuel supplier China Aviation Oil has offered to repay its creditors $220m (\\u00c2\\u00a3117m) of the $550m it lost on trading in oil futures.\\n \\n The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years. With assets of $200m and liabilities totalling $648m, it needs creditors' backing for the offer to avoid going into bankruptcy. The trading scandal is the biggest to hit Singapore since the $1.2bn collapse of Barings Bank in 1995. Chen Jiulin, chief executive of China Aviation Oil (CAO), was arrested by at Changi Airport by Singapore police on 8 December. He was returning from China, where he had headed when CAO announced its trading debacle in late-November. The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead.\\n \\n Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy. Of the immediate payment, the firm - China's biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $30m out of its own resources. The rest would come from its parent company, China Aviation Oil Holding Company in Beijing. The holding company, owned by the Chinese government, holds most of CAO's Singapore-listed shares. It cut its holding from 75% to 60% on 20 October.\\n\",\n          \"Yukos heading back to US courts\\n \\n Russian oil and gas company Yukos is due in a US court on Thursday as it continues to fight for its survival.\\n \\n The firm is in the process of being broken up by Russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (\\u00c2\\u00a314bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, Yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm Rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted.\\n \\n Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated US bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means. The company wants damages of $20bn, claiming Yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. Judge Letitia Clark will hear different motions, including one from Deutsche Bank to throw out the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The German lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for Yuganskneftegas. Deutsche Bank, which is also an advisor to Gazprom, has called on the US court to overturn its decision to provide Yukos with bankruptcy protection.\\n \\n Lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify Deutsche Bank's business position, analysts said.\\n \\n Analysts are not optimistic about Yukos' chances in court. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country's legal authorities have repeatedly said that the US has no jurisdiction over Yukos and its legal wranglings. On top of that, the firm only has limited assets in the US. Yukos has won small victories, however, and is bullish about its chances in court. \\\"Do we have an ability to influence what happens? We think we do,\\\" said Mike Lake, a Yukos spokesman. \\\"The litigation risks are real,\\\" said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Vadim Mitroshin The dispute with the Russian authorities is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"df"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-99e1d149-5fd3-4f12-ba18-879e2a10fc1a\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Budget to set scene for election\\n \\n Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\\n \\n Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about Â£2bn to spare.\\n \\n - Increase in the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000 \\n  - A freeze on petrol duty \\n  - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \\n  - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than Â£60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to Â£150,000 in February.\\n \\n The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around Â£10bn.\"\\n \\n But Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a Â£35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\\n \\n For the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a Â£2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to Â£5.60 an hour.\\n</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Army chiefs in regiments decision\\n \\n Military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland's Army regiments.\\n \\n A committee of the Army Board, which is made up of the most senior defence figures, will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on Monday. The proposals include cutting Scotland's six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment. The plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. The committee's decision must be ratified by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Prime Minister Tony Blair. It is expected that it will be made public next week. When ministers announced a reorganisation of the Army it drew a question mark over the futures of the Black Watch, the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In October, the Council of Scottish Colonels proposed the merger of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers into a single battalion.\\n \\n Under their vision, it would be one of five in the new super regiment. The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with Labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan. They felt the timing was insensitive because the Black Watch was in the frontline in Iraq, suffering casualties. The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election.\\n \\n Speaking ahead of the expected Army Board meeting, a spokesman said: \"The government and the Army Board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the Scottish regiments are for the good of the Army and for that of the serving soldier. \"They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotland's regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world.\" An alternative blueprint had been put forward by Labour MP Eric Joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely. Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely. He said: \"They don't want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it, all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly.\" The prime minister said he hoped campaigners' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.\\n</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Howard denies split over ID cards\\n \\n Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.\\n \\n The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a \"collective view\" after holding a \"good discussion\", but admitted it was \"not an easy issue\". He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\\n \\n Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n \\n He acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\\n \\n Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n \\n They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and \"deeply flawed\". He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.\"\\n \\n The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a \"regressive\" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britain's ethnic minorities being stopped by police.\\n</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Observers to monitor UK election\\n \\n Ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming UK general election is fairly run.\\n \\n The move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. A report by two MPs committees called on Thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election.\\n \\n Junior constitutional affairs minister Christopher Leslie said: \"I fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced.\" The government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.\\n \\n But trial all-postal ballots in four English regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges \"on a scale not seen since the 19th Century\". Thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). It said that, with the growth of postal voting, there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually, rather than by household. It also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.\\n \\n Figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. Young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could \"dramatically reduce the chances of fraud\". But his counterpart on the DCA committee, Alan Beith, said it should be delayed \"until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective.\" Shadow Constitutional Affairs Secretary Oliver Heald accused the government of \"dragging its feet\" over \"this badly needed measure\". \"It is vital that we move ahead with the Northern Ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the Britain's electoral system,\" he said.\\n \\n The report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in Northern Ireland when it was introduced in 2002. The report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. It said incentives to register, such as Â£20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as \"gimmicks\" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said. Instead they called for \"imaginative campaigns\" to boost interest.\\n</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Kilroy names election seat target\\n \\n Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\\n \\n Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\\n \\n On Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\\n \\n UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\\n \\n UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said.

He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\\n \\n Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about Â£2bn to spare.\\n \\n - Increase in the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000 \\n  - A freeze on petrol duty \\n  - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \\n  - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than Â£60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to Â£150,000 in February.\\n \\n The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around Â£10bn.\"\\n \\n But Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a Â£35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\\n \\n For the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a Â£2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to Â£5.60 an hour.\\n\n","1                                                                                                                                                     Army chiefs in regiments decision\\n \\n Military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland's Army regiments.\\n \\n A committee of the Army Board, which is made up of the most senior defence figures, will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on Monday. The proposals include cutting Scotland's six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment. The plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. The committee's decision must be ratified by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Prime Minister Tony Blair. It is expected that it will be made public next week. When ministers announced a reorganisation of the Army it drew a question mark over the futures of the Black Watch, the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In October, the Council of Scottish Colonels proposed the merger of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers into a single battalion.\\n \\n Under their vision, it would be one of five in the new super regiment. The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with Labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan. They felt the timing was insensitive because the Black Watch was in the frontline in Iraq, suffering casualties. The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election.\\n \\n Speaking ahead of the expected Army Board meeting, a spokesman said: \"The government and the Army Board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the Scottish regiments are for the good of the Army and for that of the serving soldier. \"They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotland's regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world.\" An alternative blueprint had been put forward by Labour MP Eric Joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely. Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely. He said: \"They don't want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it, all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly.\" The prime minister said he hoped campaigners' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.\\n\n","2  Howard denies split over ID cards\\n \\n Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.\\n \\n The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a \"collective view\" after holding a \"good discussion\", but admitted it was \"not an easy issue\". He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\\n \\n Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n \\n He acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\\n \\n Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n \\n They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and \"deeply flawed\". He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.\"\\n \\n The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a \"regressive\" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britain's ethnic minorities being stopped by police.\\n\n","3                                                                             Observers to monitor UK election\\n \\n Ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming UK general election is fairly run.\\n \\n The move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. A report by two MPs committees called on Thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election.\\n \\n Junior constitutional affairs minister Christopher Leslie said: \"I fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced.\" The government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.\\n \\n But trial all-postal ballots in four English regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges \"on a scale not seen since the 19th Century\". Thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). It said that, with the growth of postal voting, there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually, rather than by household. It also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.\\n \\n Figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. Young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could \"dramatically reduce the chances of fraud\". But his counterpart on the DCA committee, Alan Beith, said it should be delayed \"until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective.\" Shadow Constitutional Affairs Secretary Oliver Heald accused the government of \"dragging its feet\" over \"this badly needed measure\". \"It is vital that we move ahead with the Northern Ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the Britain's electoral system,\" he said.\\n \\n The report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in Northern Ireland when it was introduced in 2002. The report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. It said incentives to register, such as Â£20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as \"gimmicks\" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said. Instead they called for \"imaginative campaigns\" to boost interest.\\n\n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Kilroy names election seat target\\n \\n Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\\n \\n Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\\n \\n On Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\\n \\n UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\\n \\n UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\\n"]},"execution_count":39,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fd5gXDREj_S0"},"source":["Importing the necessary libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"6CyR5Xkwfdnf"},"outputs":[],"source":["# installing the sentence-transformers library\n","!pip install -U sentence-transformers -q"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4,"status":"ok","timestamp":1756794583728,"user":{"displayName":"Boogeyman","userId":"04170040929750470005"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"h4OfellTBYL6","outputId":"39be1e31-1237-4621-d298-fa13cf510e72"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["(2225, 1)"]},"execution_count":41,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df.shape"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":115},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1756794584875,"user":{"displayName":"Boogeyman","userId":"04170040929750470005"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"cLofxuoaBacq","outputId":"2a0f3328-1bfd-4a76-ee00-5e4b14437cc7"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Text</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> int64</label>"],"text/plain":["Text    0\n","dtype: int64"]},"execution_count":42,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df.isnull().sum()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":487},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":168,"status":"ok","timestamp":1756794586361,"user":{"displayName":"Boogeyman","userId":"04170040929750470005"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"kV1o8XWhBePt","outputId":"271f4099-a44f-408f-9ca4-f029a88bba50"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"summary":"{\n  \"name\": \"df\",\n  \"rows\": 4,\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2127,\n          \"2\",\n          \"2225\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-91b32e54-d385-4d97-82c6-d31628c3e29e\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>count</th>\n","      <td>2225</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>unique</th>\n","      <td>2127</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>top</th>\n","      <td>Kenyan school turns to handhelds\\n \\n At the Mbita Point primary school in western Kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus.\\n \\n They are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. It is a pilot project run by EduVision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. Matthew Herren from EduVision told the BBC programme Go Digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called E-slates. \"The E-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. This in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. The data is transmitted alongside audio signals.\" The base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld E-slates. \"It downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream, sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. It also stores this on its hard disc.\"\\n \\n The system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. But Mr Herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. \"It's very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it's also a one-way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult.\"\\n \\n The project is still at the pilot stage and EduVision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the Linux-based system. \"The content is divided into visual information, textual information and questions. Users can scroll through these sections independently of each other.\" EduVision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. Mr Herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. He is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site Google to digitise some of the world's largest university libraries. \"All books in the public domain, something like 15 million, could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. Then every rural school in Africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in Oxford and Harvard\" Currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. But Mr Herren says EduVision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions. \"We plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station, have the E-slates charge during the day when the children are in school, then they can take them home at night and continue working.\" Maciej Sundra, who designed the user interface for the E-slates, says the project's ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. \"Why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks?

school turns to handhelds\\n \\n At the Mbita Point primary school in western Kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus.\\n \\n They are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. It is a pilot project run by EduVision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. Matthew Herren from EduVision told the BBC programme Go Digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called E-slates. \"The E-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. This in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. The data is transmitted alongside audio signals.\" The base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld E-slates. \"It downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream, sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. It also stores this on its hard disc.\"\\n \\n The system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. But Mr Herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. \"It's very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it's also a one-way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult.\"\\n \\n The project is still at the pilot stage and EduVision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the Linux-based system. \"The content is divided into visual information, textual information and questions. Users can scroll through these sections independently of each other.\" EduVision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. Mr Herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. He is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site Google to digitise some of the world's largest university libraries. \"All books in the public domain, something like 15 million, could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. Then every rural school in Africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in Oxford and Harvard\" Currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. But Mr Herren says EduVision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions. \"We plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station, have the E-slates charge during the day when the children are in school, then they can take them home at night and continue working.\" Maciej Sundra, who designed the user interface for the E-slates, says the project's ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. \"Why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks? The fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting - as they need it most.\"\\n\n","freq

meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland's Army regiments.\\n \\n A committee of the Army Board, which is made up of the most senior defence figures, will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on Monday. The proposals include cutting Scotland's six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment. The plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. The committee's decision must be ratified by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Prime Minister Tony Blair. It is expected that it will be made public next week. When ministers announced a reorganisation of the Army it drew a question mark over the futures of the Black Watch, the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In October, the Council of Scottish Colonels proposed the merger of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers into a single battalion.\\n \\n Under their vision, it would be one of five in the new super regiment. The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with Labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan. They felt the timing was insensitive because the Black Watch was in the frontline in Iraq, suffering casualties. The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election.\\n \\n Speaking ahead of the expected Army Board meeting, a spokesman said: \"The government and the Army Board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the Scottish regiments are for the good of the Army and for that of the serving soldier. \"They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotland's regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world.\" An alternative blueprint had been put forward by Labour MP Eric Joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely. Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely. He said: \"They don't want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it, all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly.\" The prime minister said he hoped campaigners' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.\\n</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> object</label>"],"text/plain":["1    Army chiefs in regiments decision\\n \\n Military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland's Army regiments.\\n \\n A committee of the Army Board, which is made up of the most senior defence figures, will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on Monday.

But foreign aid is due to rise by 10%, with more money to treat HIV/Aids and reward economic and political reform. Military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn. The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.\n"," \n"," Congress will spend several months debating George W Bush's proposal.\n"," \n"," The state department's planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost $6bn to assist US allies in the \"war on terror\". However, the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle HIV/Aids, the BBC's Jonathan Beale reports, and planned spending would almost double to $3bn, with much of that money going to African nations. Mr Bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his Millennium Challenge Corporation. The scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the US considers to be good governance and sound policies. Yet Mr Bush's proposed spending of $3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of $5bn.\n"," \n"," A key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of Social Security, the pensions programme on which many Americans rely for their retirement income.\n"," \n"," Some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5 trillion over a 20-year period. Neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the US emergency petroleum stockpile. Concern over the level of the reserve, created in 1970s, has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. The Bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil - rather than cash - from energy companies that drill under federal leases.\n"," \n"," The outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 9.6% at Agriculture and 5.6% at the Environmental Protection Agency. The spending plan for the year beginning 1 October is banking on a healthy US economy to boost government income by 6.1% to $2.18 trillion. Spending is forecast to grow by 3.5% to $2.57 trillion. But the budget is still the tightest yet under Mr Bush's presidency. \"In order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,\" Mr Bush said in his budget message to Congress. Mr Bush has promised to halve the US's massive budget deficit within five years. The deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in Mr Bush's presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the US dollar lower. The independent Congressional Budget Office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than $200bn by 2009, returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012. But its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent, in line with the promise when they were passed that they would \"sunset\", or disappear, in 2010. Most Republicans, however, want them to stay in place. And the figures also rely on the \"Social Security trust fund\" - the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions - being offset against the main budget deficit.\n","\n","*******************************************************************\n","\n","\n","Will the Budget bring out smiling voters?\n"," \n"," As Tory spokesman Oliver Letwin said - any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners, wouldn't he.\n"," \n"," And everyone does, indeed, expect Gordon Brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of 5 May. There will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways. But Mr Brown will stun Westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters' faces and make them more inclined to back Labour in the election. And there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week's Budget. The aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core Labour voters in the fold, while ensuring the middle England voters who gave Tony Blair two election victories don't desert him at the third poll.\n"," \n"," And, needless to say, there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the Budget will have on Mr Brown's own ambitions to replace Mr Blair as prime minister at some point after a third win. But there is a shadow hanging over this pre-election performance - in the shape of Â£11 billion or thereabouts. That is the size of the financial \"black hole\" the Tories, backed by some independent forecasters, believe Mr Brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election.\n"," \n"," The opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a Treasury leak suggested Mr Brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash. It was immediately denied, but the Tories remain suspicious, claiming that, as Mr Letwin said, if the money does not come from there, where will it come from.\n"," \n"," Mr Brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election, should Labour win. Previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong, he will argue, while suggesting that only by sticking with him can Britain continue to have a sound economy, low unemployment and high public spending. The opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound, increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.\n"," \n"," The Liberal Democrats will also promise to run a sound economy, but based on increased taxes to fund spending and, amongst other things, abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax. And there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in Whitehall and beyond to fund their policies. But probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years. And it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election.\n","\n","*******************************************************************\n","\n","\n","Brown names 16 March for Budget\n"," \n"," Chancellor Gordon Brown will deliver his Budget to the House of Commons on 16 March, the Treasury has announced.\n"," \n"," The Budget, likely to be the last before the General Election, will be at about 1230 GMT on that Wednesday, just after Prime Minister's question time. The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions. The Tories say it is likely the Budget will contain measures to attract votes. The election is expected on 5 May.\n"," \n"," Next month's Budget will be Mr Brown's ninth since Labour came to power in 1997. If a May election is called, there could be as little as 18 days between the Budget and the announcement of a date for the election. A shortened Finance Bill would have to be rushed through Parliament with all-party support to allow the Government to continue collecting revenue.\n"," \n"," The full Finance Bill, with the Budget measures in it, would then be returned to the Commons after the election, if Labour secures another term in office. Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"We can be sure of two things: the Budget will contain measures to attract votes, and it will not contain the Â£8 billion of tax rises which independent experts say are inevitable if Labour wins the election.\" As Mr Brown announced the Budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm Ernst & Young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy. \"In the Budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections, taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and, in many cases, taxes were increased soon after the election result,\" said Aidan O'Carroll, E&Y's UK head of tax.\n","\n","*******************************************************************\n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["# defining the query text\n","query_text = \"Budget for elections\"\n","\n","# displaying the top 5 similar sentences\n","top_k_reviews = top_k_similar_sentences(embedding_matrix, query_text, 5)\n","\n","for i in top_k_reviews:\n","    print(i, end=\"\\n\")\n","    print(\"*******************************************************************\")\n","    print(\"\\n\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8,"status":"ok","timestamp":1756793940740,"user":{"displayName":"Boogeyman","userId":"04170040929750470005"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"fQ-CBZ1bIVSL","outputId":"e50bfbc8-30a1-42d5-d40c-7d4bd5b7513b"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["US trade gap ballooned in October\n"," \n"," The US trade deficit widened by more than expected in October, hitting record levels after higher oil prices raised import costs, figures have shown\n"," \n"," The trade shortfall was $55.5bn (Â£29bn), up 9% from September, the Commerce Department said. That pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn. Imports rose by 3.4%, while exports increased by only 0.6%. A weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports, though this should help drive export demand in coming months. \"Things are getting worse, but that's to be expected,\" said David Wyss of Standard & Poor's in New York. \"The first thing is that when the dollar goes down, it increases the price of imports. \"We are seeing improved export orders. Things seem to be going in the right direction.\"\n"," \n"," Despite this optimism, significant concerns remain as to how the US will fund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen. Another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with China, which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports. The US imported almost $20bn worth of goods from China during October, exporting a little under $3bn. \"It seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains,\" said Anthony Crescenzi, a bond strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. The trade deficit and the shortfall with China \"are big issues going forward\". The Commerce Department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a fifth time this year. Borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25% at a Fed meeting later on Tuesday.\n","\n","*******************************************************************\n","\n","\n","Trade gap narrows as exports rise\n"," \n"," The UK's trade gap narrowed in November, helped by a 7.5% rise in exports outside the European Union.\n"," \n"," According to the Office for National Statistics, the difference between what the UK exported and imported was Â£3.1bn ($5.8bn), down from October's Â£3.6bn. Overall UK exports - including both goods and services - rose by more than 3.2% to Â£24.8bn, although total imports rose again to a new record of Â£27.9bn. The deficit for goods alone was Â£4.6bn, down from October's Â£5bn. During November the UK exported Â£16.9bn worth of goods, but imported Â£21.5bn. The cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 now stands at Â£36.3bn, Â£4.5bn higher than the same period in 2003.\n"," \n"," November saw an improvement in export levels to both the European Union and the rest of the world, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. EU exports rose 2%, fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals. Non-EU exports shot up 7.5%, with growth seen across a range of manufacturing sectors including cars, consumer durables and chemicals. The export boost offset a 1% rise in imports. Non-EU imports rose 3%, but the growth in goods entering the UK from the EU slowed to 0.5%.\n"," \n"," The UK's deficit with the EU fell to Â£1.9bn from Â£2.1bn, while its non-EU shortfall dropped to Â£2.7bn from Â£2.9bn in October.\n"," \n"," The country's surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at Â£1.5bn for the fifth month in a row. Paul Dales, UK economist for Capital Economics, said the figures represented an improvement on recent months. However, he stressed that the long-term prognosis for exports was still uncertain. \"The figures are a lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor,\" he said. \"There have been some very encouraging signs that the UK export recovery is starting to take hold. But there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent.\"\n","\n","*******************************************************************\n","\n","\n","US trade gap hits record in 2004\n"," \n"," The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (Â£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.\n"," \n"," The Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn. The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to Â£56.4bn. The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.\n"," \n"," Democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\n"," \n"," Meanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.\n","\n","*******************************************************************\n","\n","\n","FAO warns on impact of subsidies\n"," \n"," Billions of farmers' livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism, the UN's Food & Agriculture Organisation has warned.\n"," \n"," Trade barriers and subsidies \"severely\" distort the market, the FAO report on the \"State of Agricultural Commodity Markets 2004\" said. As a result, the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. The most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. The FAO report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.\n"," \n"," The FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries' access to the world market. It also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.\n"," \n"," According to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. In fact, almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (Â£158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said. The first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product. These countries are mainly situated in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.\n","\n","*******************************************************************\n","\n","\n","Chinese exports rise 25% in 2004\n"," \n"," Exports from China leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth.\n"," \n"," The spurt put China's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. It may also increase pressure on China to relax the peg joining its currency, the yuan, with the weakening dollar. The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. State Administration of Taxation head Xie Xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; Â£165bn).\n"," \n"," According to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. With imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. The increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to Mr Xie. China's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with China a sensitive political issue in Washington. The peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses at home. A US report issued on Tuesday on behalf of a Congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003. The pace accelerated in the final three years of the period, said the report for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors. The US's overall trade deficit with China was $124bn in 2003, and is expected to rise to about $150bn for 2004.\n","\n","*******************************************************************\n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["# defining the query text\n","query_text = \"High imports and exports\"\n","\n","#

second term as president.\\n \\n Mr Bush's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was \\\"fractured, divided and uncertain\\\", Mr Blair said. It had to be brought together, he added, saying action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey. Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.\\n \\n But there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by \\\"military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values\\\" he added. Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most \\\"pressing political challenge\\\" of the present day, Mr Blair warned. The prime minister also urged Europe and the US to \\\"build anew their alliance\\\".\\n \\n \\\"All of us in positions of leadership, not just President Bush, have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. It is urgent that we do so.\\\" Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election \\\"a true celebration of American democracy\\\". The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added. Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his \\\"warmest congratulations\\\", saying: \\\"We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom.\\\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000.\\n \\n Mr Bush's first task was to \\\"rebuild a sense of domestic purpose\\\" within the US, he said. Mr Kennedy said: \\\"Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism.\\\" Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an \\\"umbilical cord\\\" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.\\n \\n \\\"Europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character, and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security. \\\"Iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come.\\\" Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.\\n \\n Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday. Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite George Bush's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. Public opinion would force change, she told BBC news. But Myron Ebell, an adviser on climate change to President Bush, has said there would be no change in the US stance and rejected the threat of climate change. He claimed the US was the only country with independent scientists.\\n\",\n          \"China Aviation seeks rescue deal\\n \\n Scandal-hit jet fuel supplier China Aviation Oil has offered to repay its creditors $220m (\\u00c2\\u00a3117m) of the $550m it lost on trading in oil futures.\\n \\n The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years. With assets of $200m and liabilities totalling $648m, it needs creditors' backing for the offer to avoid going into bankruptcy. The trading scandal is the biggest to hit Singapore since the $1.2bn collapse of Barings Bank in 1995. Chen Jiulin, chief executive of China Aviation Oil (CAO), was arrested by at Changi Airport by Singapore police on 8 December. He was returning from China, where he had headed when CAO announced its trading debacle in late-November. The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead.\\n \\n Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy. Of the immediate payment, the firm - China's biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $30m out of its own resources. The rest would come from its parent company, China Aviation Oil Holding Company in Beijing. The holding company, owned by the Chinese government, holds most of CAO's Singapore-listed shares. It cut its holding from 75% to 60% on 20 October.\\n\",\n          \"Yukos heading back to US courts\\n \\n Russian oil and gas company Yukos is due in a US court on Thursday as it continues to fight for its survival.\\n \\n The firm is in the process of being broken up by Russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (\\u00c2\\u00a314bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, Yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm Rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted.\\n \\n Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated US bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means. The company wants damages of $20bn, claiming Yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. Judge Letitia Clark will hear different motions, including one from Deutsche Bank to throw out the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The German lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for Yuganskneftegas. Deutsche Bank, which is also an advisor to Gazprom, has called on the US court to overturn its decision to provide Yukos with bankruptcy protection.\\n \\n Lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify Deutsche Bank's business position, analysts said.\\n \\n Analysts are not optimistic about Yukos' chances in court. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country's legal authorities have repeatedly said that the US has no jurisdiction over Yukos and its legal wranglings. On top of that, the firm only has limited assets in the US. Yukos has won small victories, however, and is bullish about its chances in court. \\\"Do we have an ability to influence what happens? We think we do,\\\" said Mike Lake, a Yukos spokesman. \\\"The litigation risks are real,\\\" said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Vadim Mitroshin The dispute with the Russian authorities is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          2,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"clustered_data"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-45524348-e261-49a6-b77a-3a87abb7d542\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Text</th>\n","      <th>Category</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Budget to set scene for election\\n \\n Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\\n \\n Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about Â£2bn to spare.\\n \\n - Increase in the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000 \\n  - A freeze on petrol duty \\n  - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \\n  - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than Â£60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to Â£150,000 in February.\\n \\n The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around Â£10bn.\"\\n \\n But Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a Â£35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\\n \\n For the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a Â£2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to Â£5.60 an hour.\\n</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Army chiefs in regiments decision\\n \\n Military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland's Army regiments.\\n \\n A committee of the Army Board, which is made up of the most senior defence figures, will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on Monday. The proposals include cutting Scotland's six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment. The plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. The committee's decision must be ratified by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Prime Minister Tony Blair. It is expected that it will be made public next week. When ministers announced a reorganisation of the Army it drew a question mark over the futures of the Black Watch, the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In October, the Council of Scottish Colonels proposed the merger of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers into a single battalion.\\n \\n Under their vision, it would be one of five in the new super regiment. The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with Labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan. They felt the timing was insensitive because the Black Watch was in the frontline in Iraq, suffering casualties. The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election.\\n \\n Speaking ahead of the expected Army Board meeting, a spokesman said: \"The government and the Army Board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the Scottish regiments are for the good of the Army and for that of the serving soldier. \"They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotland's regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world.\" An alternative blueprint had been put forward by Labour MP Eric Joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely. Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely. He said: \"They don't want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it, all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly.\" The prime minister said he hoped campaigners' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.\\n</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Howard denies split over ID cards\\n \\n Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.\\n \\n The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a \"collective view\" after holding a \"good discussion\", but admitted it was \"not an easy issue\". He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\\n \\n Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n \\n He acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\\n \\n Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n \\n They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and \"deeply flawed\". He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.\"\\n \\n The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a \"regressive\" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britain's ethnic minorities being stopped by police.\\n</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Observers to monitor UK election\\n \\n Ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming UK general election is fairly run.\\n \\n The move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. A report by two MPs committees called on Thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election.\\n \\n Junior constitutional affairs minister Christopher Leslie said: \"I fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced.\" The government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.\\n \\n But trial all-postal ballots in four English regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges \"on a scale not seen since the 19th Century\". Thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). It said that, with the growth of postal voting, there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually, rather than by household. It also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.\\n \\n Figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. Young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could \"dramatically reduce the chances of fraud\". But his counterpart on the DCA committee, Alan Beith, said it should be delayed \"until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective.\" Shadow Constitutional Affairs Secretary Oliver Heald accused the government of \"dragging its feet\" over \"this badly needed measure\". \"It is vital that we move ahead with the Northern Ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the Britain's electoral system,\" he said.\\n \\n The report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in Northern Ireland when it was introduced in 2002. The report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. It said incentives to register, such as Â£20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as \"gimmicks\" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said. Instead they called for \"imaginative campaigns\" to boost interest.\\n</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Kilroy names election seat target\\n \\n Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\\n \\n Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\\n \\n On Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\\n \\n UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\\n \\n UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\\n</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-45524348-e261-49a6-b77a-3a87abb7d542')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-45524348-e261-49a6-b77a-3a87abb7d542 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\\n \\n Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about Â£2bn to spare.\\n \\n - Increase in the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000 \\n  - A freeze on petrol duty \\n  - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \\n  - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than Â£60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to Â£150,000 in February.\\n \\n The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around Â£10bn.\"\\n \\n But Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a Â£35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\\n \\n For the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a Â£2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to Â£5.60 an hour.\\n   \n","1                                                                                                                                                     Army chiefs in regiments decision\\n \\n Military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland's Army regiments.\\n \\n A committee of the Army Board, which is made up of the most senior defence figures, will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on Monday. The proposals include cutting Scotland's six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment. The plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. The committee's decision must be ratified by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Prime Minister Tony Blair. It is expected that it will be made public next week. When ministers announced a reorganisation of the Army it drew a question mark over the futures of the Black Watch, the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In October, the Council of Scottish Colonels proposed the merger of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers into a single battalion.\\n \\n Under their vision, it would be one of five in the new super regiment. The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with Labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan. They felt the timing was insensitive because the Black Watch was in the frontline in Iraq, suffering casualties. The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election.\\n \\n Speaking ahead of the expected Army Board meeting, a spokesman said: \"The government and the Army Board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the Scottish regiments are for the good of the Army and for that of the serving soldier. \"They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotland's regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world.\" An alternative blueprint had been put forward by Labour MP Eric Joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely. Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely. He said: \"They don't want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it, all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly.\" The prime minister said he hoped campaigners' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.\\n   \n","2  Howard denies split over ID cards\\n \\n Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.\\n \\n The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a \"collective view\" after holding a \"good discussion\", but admitted it was \"not an easy issue\". He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\\n \\n Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n \\n He acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\\n \\n Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n \\n They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and \"deeply flawed\". He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.\"\\n \\n The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a \"regressive\" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britain's ethnic minorities being stopped by police.\\n   \n","3                                                                             Observers to monitor UK election\\n \\n Ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming UK general election is fairly run.\\n \\n The move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. A report by two MPs committees called on Thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election.\\n \\n Junior constitutional affairs minister Christopher Leslie said: \"I fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced.\" The government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.\\n \\n But trial all-postal ballots in four English regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges \"on a scale not seen since the 19th Century\". Thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). It said that, with the growth of postal voting, there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually, rather than by household. It also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.\\n \\n Figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. Young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could \"dramatically reduce the chances of fraud\". But his counterpart on the DCA committee, Alan Beith, said it should be delayed \"until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective.\" Shadow Constitutional Affairs Secretary Oliver Heald accused the government of \"dragging its feet\" over \"this badly needed measure\". \"It is vital that we move ahead with the Northern Ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the Britain's electoral system,\" he said.\\n \\n The report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in Northern Ireland when it was introduced in 2002. The report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. It said incentives to register, such as Â£20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as \"gimmicks\" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said. Instead they called for \"imaginative campaigns\" to boost interest.\\n   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Kilroy names election seat target\\n \\n Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\\n \\n Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\\n \\n On Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\\n \\n UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\\n \\n UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\\n   \n","\n","   Category  \n","0         1  \n","1         1  \n","2         1  \n","3         1  \n","4         1  "]},"execution_count":31,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# creating a copy of the data\n","clustered_data = df.copy()\n","\n","# assigning the cluster/category labels\n","clustered_data['Category'] = Kmeans.labels_\n","\n","clustered_data.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":210,"status":"ok","timestamp":1756794336702,"user":{"displayName":"Boogeyman","userId":"04170040929750470005"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"uMmChTDeGRoZ","outputId":"652686af-4119-445a-c9f3-141ea57fdd79"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["CLUSTER 0\n","['India to deport Bollywood actress\\n \\n India has ordered the deportation of Iranian-born model and actress Negar Khan to Norway after saying she was working illegally on her visa.\\n \\n Khan has had raunchy roles in music videos and Bollywood films over the past two years.

Goodrem, known in both Britain and Australia for her role as Nina Tucker in TV soap Neighbours, also performed a duet with boyfriend Brian McFadden. Other winners included Green Day, voted best group, and the Black Eyed Peas. Goodrem, Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas took home two awards each. As well as best female, Goodrem also took home the Pepsi Viewers Choice Award, whilst Green Day bagged the prize for best rock video for American Idiot.

Dirty War - screened uncut on BBC One last September - depicts a dirty bomb attack on the City of London. It is also being screened uncut on US cable channel HBO on 24 January. PBS said it will use extra footage for its broadcast, showing the woman \"from a more discreet angle\" instead.\\n \\n The US Federal Communications Commission fined CBS $550,000 (Â£306,814) last autumn for singer Janet Jackson\\'s \"wardrobe malfunction\", during which her breast was exposed during a dance routine with Justin Timberlake. Many US networks and broadcasters are now more nervous about airing nudity, violence or bad language. Ms Atlas said PBS could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of Dirty War, and it could also deter many of its 170 individual stations from airing \"an important film\". \"You want to pick your battles,\" she said. She added that PBS, which is a private, non-profit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation\\'s 349 public television stations, is bolder about screening non-fiction or historical programming. PBS is seen in virtually all US homes with TV, and describes itself as a \"trusted community resource\" serving nearly 100 million people each week.\\n'\n"," 'Oscars steer clear of controversy\\n \\n The Oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema.\\n \\n If best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be Michael Moore\\'s Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson\\'s The Passion of the Christ. Both films polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see them - Fahrenheit 9/11 breaking US box office records for a documentary, and The Passion of the Christ making more than US$370m (Â£196m) in the US alone. But this year\\'s Academy Awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with The Passion of the Christ - a film accused of being anti-Semitic - receiving nominations only in the \\'minor\\' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.\\n \\n Fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the Palme d\\'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2004.\\n \\n Moore\\'s caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors\\' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International. But he also believes the strong political viewpoint of Moore\\'s film does not sit well with the Academy. \"If you look at past Oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative Oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. Fahrenheit 9/11 didn\\'t really fit in to that category. \"They tend to go for films like Titanic, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings, films with scale that often aren\\'t too contentious,\" he said. While he said the Oscar voting panel were not \"snubbing\" Moore\\'s film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. \"I think it\\'s more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,\" he said.\\n \\n The problem with Mel Gibson\\'s film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in Aramaic, an ancient Middle Eastern language.\\n \\n \"Hollywood doesn\\'t tend to like foreign-language films - no-one\\'s ever tried doing a film in a dead language,\" he said. But aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category. The film has caused some controversy in showing Hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster. But Mr Dams said: \"It\\'s not an inflammatory film. It has done very well in Germany, and it\\'s a film that portrays Hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster.\" Another \\'contentious\\' film, Mr Dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.\\n \\n Independent film-maker Morgan Spurlock may have forced fast-food giant McDonalds to withdraw its \\'super size\\' portions in the US after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but McDonalds meals - and filmed his progress.\\n \\n The film has been a hit around the world. Mr Dams said: \"It\\'s a political film, but it\\'s quite fun and punky and well-paced. \"Morgan Spurlock is a really likeable guy. It\\'s a very accessible film, and it doesn\\'t beat you over the head with its views. \"While in Fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy, I think the way that Super Size Me is put together - the fact it\\'s a very likeable film - means it\\'s won through on charm.\" Dam\\'s pick at this year\\'s Oscars? The Aviator, Martin Scorsese\\'s biopic of aviation pioneer and Hollywood player Howard Hughes. Tinseltown, it seems, likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.\\n'\n"," 'Queen recruit singer for new tour\\n \\n The remaining members of rock band Queen are to go on tour next year with former Free and Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers taking Freddie Mercury\\'s place.\\n \\n Guitarist Brian May has said he expects to be on the road with Rodgers and drummer Roger Taylor from April. May said: \"Suddenly the Queen Phoenix is rising again from the ashes and will take precedence over... our lives.\" Queen have played with many different singers since Mercury\\'s death in 1991 but have reportedly not toured. May performed with Rodgers at a concert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar in London in September.\\n \\n \"We were both so amazed at the chemistry that was going on in [Free hit] All Right Now, that suddenly it seems blindingly obvious that there was \\'something happening here,\\'\" May wrote on his website. They teamed up again for a concert to mark their induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and were joined by Taylor. \"The show went so incredibly well from our point of view, and we got so many rave reactions from out there, we decided almost then and there that we would look at a tour together,\" May wrote.\\n \\n Queen went to number one in 2000 with a version of We Will Rock You sung by boy band 5ive and they have also played with Robbie Williams, Will Young and Bob Geldof. Queen bassist John Deacon has currently retired from the stage. Rodgers was singer with early 1970s rockers Free, who had a global hit with All Right Now, before forming Bad Company, a successful \"supergroup\" with members of King Crimson and Mott the Hoople.

The problem, according to Mr Lane, is not continuing divisions over Iraq, foundation hospitals or tuition fees, or even voter apathy, but Mr Blair himself. \"I have a new slogan. Vote Blair, Get Brown. That\\'s what I am telling people on the doorstep. Don\\'t worry, he will be gone soon.\" His friend, Saxon Spence, leader of Devon county Labour group, lays the blame for any lack of campaigning zeal on one issue above all others. \"You cannot underestimate the impact of the war in Iraq. We lost people from our local party who had some key roles.\"\\n \\n But the two friends were fired up by Gordon Brown\\'s speech on Saturday, with its appeal to core Labour values on social justice, health and education.\\n \\n \"There was real passion. I think we have all felt a little jaded, but it reminded us why we joined the party in the first place,\" said Mrs Spence. \"If he hadn\\'t have walked off the stage, they would still be clapping,\" added Mr Lane. But for every Brownite at the spring conference there was an equally ardent fan of Mr Blair. Stephen Douglas, 26, from Wales, said after the PM\\'s speech on Sunday: \"I think it was a bit of a turning point, given the roasting he has had on some issues. The guy still has it.\"\\n \\n Tony Martin, of Burnley, said: \"He is the first leader who has won us two terms. This bloke has delivered for us.\" Malcolm Shipley, of Shipley, said it was \"as if he is coming round to the right approach again\". Katrina Bull, a prospective parliamentary candidate said Mr Blair had shown he could rouse the party\\'s grassroots: \"I think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with Tony, the way we have today, we will have no problem with turnout.\" She had just emerged from a Q&A session, in which Mr Blair - tieless and supremely at ease - answered questions posed via the party\\'s website.\\n \\n A party of councillors from Nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with Mr Blair\\'s leadership - and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever. Iraq, they insisted, would not be a factor for most voters. \"The biggest problem we have got at the moment is that we keep getting all these polls saying we are going to run away with the election. \"It might sound great, but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and I think that is the greater problem than Iraq,\" said Nottingham City Councillor Brian Parbutt. And even Mr Blair\\'s most vocal critics seemed to agree on one thing - he is a master of the sort of glossy, high-profile campaigning that has become Labour\\'s hallmark, epitomised by Friday\\'s whistle-stop tour of marginal seats. A group of shop stewards from the Swan Hunter shipyard, who said they were facing redundancy, could barely suppress their anger at Mr Blair\\'s failure to, as they saw it, shake off his Tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the North East.\\n \\n They were also scathing about the alleged benefits of showpiece projects such as conference venue Sage Centre, heralded by John Prescott and others this weekend as a symbol of Labour\\'s success in urban regeneration.\\n \\n \"It is no good having the Sage or Baltic if you haven\\'t got the money for the entrance fee,\" said Terry Telford. But when asked about Mr Blair\\'s bravura performance on Friday, the men agreed he was \"brilliant\". And they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the Labour message come election time. \"If you are not fired up about the election, then what\\'s the point? There is no complacency as far as I can see in the Labour Party. We are fired up. We are up for this election,\" said Richie Porterhouse. Mr Telford agreed, but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked \"What has Labour done for the North East?\" \"I have had doors slammed in my face,\" he said.\\n \\n Every activist I spoke to said they were proud of what they believed Labour had achieved in their local communities - the new hospitals and schools, the better life chances for young people. The problem they faced, they said, was converting this local feelgood factor into votes. But they could at least rely on one \"secret weapon\", as one activist put it - Tory leader Michael Howard.\\n'\n"," 'McConnell in \\'drunk\\' remark row\\n \\n Scotland\\'s first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk \"once in a while\".\\n \\n Jack McConnell was speaking to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. He has been criticised by the SNP for encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \"a recognition that people will get drunk\". The first minister\\'s comments came in a question and answer session at Glenurquhart High School in Inverness, attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools. A Highland councillor who was at the event has also defended Mr McConnell. Margaret Davidson, the independent member for the Loch Ness West, said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time.\\n \\n When one pupil asked Mr McConnell how the executive proposed to tackle under-age drinking, began his response with the quip: \"I\\'m sure there\\'s no under-age drinking in the Highlands.\" He went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions. He said: \"I hope I\\'m not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people\\'s health and their ability to control what\\'s happening round about them.\" Mr McConnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes, and on the health consequences of binge drinking. \"The one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that,\" he said. \"Far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly. \"We are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening.\"\\n \\n He added: \"By all means get drunk once in a while - but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly.\" SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said: \"This is an incredible gaffe by Jack McConnell. \"We all know that under-age drinking is an issue in Scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician, particularly the First Minister, should encourage young people to get drunk. \"The first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately.\" But an executive spokeswoman insisted Mr McConnell had made the remark with adults, not youngsters, in mind. \"He was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions - which are for the over-18s,\" she said. \"It was just a recognition that people will get drunk, but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable.\"\\n'\n"," 'BNP leader Nick Griffin arrested\\n \\n The leader of the British National Party has been arrested as part of a police inquiry following the screening of a BBC documentary.\\n \\n A party spokesman said Nick Griffin was arrested on Tuesday morning on suspicion of incitement to commit racial hatred.

BNP founding chairman John Tyndall was arrested on Sunday on the same charge.\\n \\n In July, the BBC documentary Secret Agent featured covertly-filmed footage of BNP activists. Mr Griffin is the twelfth man to be arrested following the documentary. Nine men from West Yorkshire and another man from Leicester have been arrested and freed on bail. Seven of the men had been held variously in connection with suspected racially aggravated public order offences, conspiracy to commit criminal damage and possession of a firearm. Two men, both from Keighley, were arrested in September on suspicion of conspiracy to commit criminal damage. A 24-year-old man from Leicester was detained on Monday on suspicion of incitement to commit racial hatred.

His comments come after the Liberal Democrats backed Tory demands that the government\\'s plans be put on hold. Andy Hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans, which come into force on 7 February. \"I feel that is a premature position to be taking,\" he said. Among those who have criticised the plans are the UK\\'s top policeman Sir John Stevens.\\n \\n The Metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24-hour drinking should be re-examined because of a binge drinking \"epidemic\". However, Mr Hayman said: \"It would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say, \\'I\\'m very sorry\\'. He said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation. \"My view is that I have got a responsibility to create an environment where that can happen, \" he said. However, he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police, local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24-hour drinking. But he is confident problems in the early days can be \"ironed out\". He believed the majority of people favoured this law change and \"we have to accept that lifestyles are changing\". But aspects such as transport, and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account.\\n \\n Prime Minister Tony Blair has defended the Licensing Act, saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in Europe because of a \"tiny minority\" of violent binge drinkers. A six-month transitional period starts on 7 February during which time venues can apply for extended licences. The Conservatives have called for 24-hour drinking to be shelved until the problems of binge drinking are solved. On Monday, the Lib Dems also called for a delay. Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"It would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours.\" Chief constable Mr Hayman acknowledged that binge drinking did cause problems. \"If you come to Norwich on a Friday or Saturday night you will see things going on that will you make you feel ashamed. \"However, I want industry to succeed in Norwich and I want Norwich to be the recognised nightspot of East Anglia. \"There is no way I want to say we cannot manage it or police it. We can.\"\\n'\n"," 'Choose hope over fear - Kennedy\\n \\n Voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election, said Charles Kennedy.\\n \\n In his New Year message the Liberal Democrat leader said Labour and the Conservatives were united in relying on fear and \"populist scares\". He said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. On the Asian tsunami he said it had been \"very heartening\" to learn of the generosity being shown by Britons. Mr Kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster, which had dominated the Christmas and New Year period. At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.\\n \\n The general election would be a three-party struggle, as the Conservative party \"fades away\" as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands, he said. \"A clear division is emerging in British politics - the politics of fear versus the politics of hope. \"Labour is counting on the politics of fear, ratcheting up talk of threats, crime and insecurity. While the Conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the European \\'menace\\',\" he said. He said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties.\\n \\n It was already using detention without trial at Belmarsh Prison, ignoring a recent Law Lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights, he said. He also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury, plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials, curbing of rights to protest, increased stop and search powers and ID card plans. He said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination. \"But at the same time, an overmighty state is a dangerous one,\" he said. His party \"instinctively\" understood the \"new liberal Britain\" which is no longer a nation with one family structure, and one colour, he said. \"We are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality. \"Our national institutions are changing too. We are no longer a nation of one church; we are a nation of many faiths.

In Sunday\\'s reverse singles, Carlos Moya takes on Andy Roddick before Rafael Nadal faces Mardy Fish. \"It feels good, but it\\'s not going to be as good if we don\\'t win two tomorrow,\" said Mike Bryan. \"It feels good to give those guys another shot, and Spain has to go to sleep on that.\" Bob Bryan added: \"I\\'m really confident in Andy winning that first match, and then anything can happen.\" Spain coach Jordi Arrese chose to rest 18-year-old Nadal in the doubles after his epic singles win over Roddick on Friday.

He is now unlikely to be fit in time for the Australian Open which begins on 17 January in Melbourne. \"He has to strengthen it enough to cope with repetitive days of tennis,\" said Hopman Cup doctor Hamish Osborne. \"It would be very unlikely in my opinion for him to do a five-setter once, let alone two days in a row, inside two weeks.\\n \\n \"The injury is more common in Australian Rules football, and a fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although Mark\\'s injury is slightly different.\" The Australian has suffered a host of injury problems throughout his career but is still holding out slim hope that he can make the event. \"It\\'s something I\\'ll have to go by feel. I\\'ll start treatment as soon as possible and try to strengthen it without tearing it any more,\" he said. \"What doesn\\'t kill you makes you stronger. I know I can come back from this and that\\'s all that matters.\\n \\n - Former world number two Tommy Haas is also a doubt for the Australian Open after picking up a thigh injury playing for Germany in the Hopman Cup. The 26-year-old had treatment on his left thigh while leading Argentine Guillermo Coria 7-5 2-2.

Taylor suffered knee ligament damage playing against Ireland in Dublin in the 2004 Six Nations championship. \"Simon is one of Scotland\\'s truly world class players so it is a huge bonus,\" said team-mate Chris Paterson. \"He brings a whole new dimension to us, especially in defence and his ability to slow the opposition ball down could be key against Italy if he is involved.\" Taylor has turned out for English side Saracens in recent weeks during a short-term loan to improve his fitness.\\n \\n Edinburgh were not in action during the first two weeks of this season\\'s Six Nations. So Taylor played the last 20 minutes of Saracens\\' win over Northampton and then 40 minutes in a friendly against South African Super 12 side The Cats. Scotland coach Matt Williams is due to name his match-day 22 on Thursday.

Oldham\\'s reward for beating Manchester City is a home tie with Bolton, while Yeovil will be away to Charlton. Chelsea host Birmingham, Tottenham travel to West Brom and Arsenal will entertain Championship side Wolves. Saints boss Redknapp was upbeat about the draw despite having to face the club he walked out on just six weeks ago. \"I\\'ve said before, I can walk away from Portsmouth with my head held high, I\\'m proud of what I did there and no one can take that away from me,\" said Redknapp. \"Maybe I\\'ll be in for some stick, there\\'s always some of that but we\\'ll get on with it and it\\'s only a game of football.\" Birmingham manager Steve Bruce admitted their trip to Stamford Bridge to face Premiership leaders Chelsea was the toughest draw possible.

Advisors Goldman Sachs are understood to have valued its demerged Deluxe Film unit at Â£300m, the report added. Speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since Rank announced a study into a possible demerger in September. Since Mike Smith's appointment as chief executive in 1999, the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses, including the Odeon cinema chain and the Pinewood studios. The move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, Hard Rock and Deluxe Films, which provides technical services to Hollywood studios.\\n \\n Rank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its Hard Rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. It also owns Deluxe Media, which makes and distributes DVDs and videos. However, that business is seen as less successful. Last year it made profits of Â£21.5m on a turnover of Â£392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to DVDs from VHS video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. A spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports, but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on Friday. Analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to Â£170m from Â£194m last year. Formed in the 1940s the firm was a leading UK film producer and cinema owner for many years. It has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the UK - including hotels, roadside service areas and holiday centres. It now owns 34 Grosvenor casinos, the Mecca Bingo chain and more than 100 Hard Rock Cafes in 38 countries.\\n\"\n"," 'Apple laptop is \\'greatest gadget\\'\\n \\n The Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time, by US magazine Mobile PC.\\n \\n The 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first \"lightweight\" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs. The magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two. Gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. The magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a \"self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own, not a subset of another device\".\\n \\n \"In general we included only items that were potentially mobile,\" said the magazine.\\n \\n \"In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget,\" it concluded. The oldest \"gadget\" in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine dates at 190 A.D., and put in 60th place. Other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamound Multimedia), as well as the first \"successful\" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac). The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13.\\n \\n Sony\\'s third entry in the top 20 is the CDP-101 CD player from 1983. \"Who can forget the crystalline, hiss-free blast of Madonna\\'s Like A Virgin emenating from their first CD player?\" asked the magazine. Karl Elsener\\'s knife, the Swiss Army Knife from 1891, is at number 20 in the list. Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd), the Nintendo GameBoy (25th), and the Pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). The list also contains plenty of oddities: the Pez sweet dispenser (98th), 1980s toy Tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th).\\n \\n Why worry about mobile phones. Soon they will be subsumed into the PDA\\'s / laptops etc.\\n \\n What about the Marine Chronometer? Completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. For it\\'s time, a technological marvel!\\n \\n Sony Net Minidisc! It paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. I always used my NetMD, and could not go anywhere without it.\\n \\n A laptop computer is not a gadget! It\\'s a working tool!\\n \\n The Sinclair Executive was the world\\'s first pocket calculator. I think this should be there as well.\\n \\n How about the clockwork radio? Or GPS? Or a pocket calculator? All these things are useful to real people, not just PC magazine editors.\\n \\n Are the people who created this list insane ? Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone? It has revolutionalised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. From outside the modern age, the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget, without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.\\n \\n Has everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker??\\n \\n An interesting list. Of the electronic gadgets, thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100. The size of A4 paper and light, three weeks on a set of batteries, an excellent keyboard, a modem. A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible.\\n \\n What\\'s an Apple Powerbook 100 ? It\\'s out of date - not much of a \"gadget\". Surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener, Swiss Army Knife, safety razor blade, wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves ?\\n \\n It has to be the mobile phone. No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.\\n \\n The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule.\\n \\n The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. A true gadget, it could be carried around and shown off.\\n \\n All top 10 are electronic toys, so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else. I say this as the Swiss Army Knife only made No 20.\\n \\n Sinclair QL a machine far ahead of its time. The first home machine with a true multi-takings OS. Shame the marketing was so bad!!!\\n \\n Apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else.\\n \\n Utter rubbish. Yes, the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets. But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer \\'gadgets\\' and rank them as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. No competition.\\n \\n I\\'d also put Apple\\'s Newton and the first Palm Pilot there as the front runners for portable computing, and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason. I only wish that Vulcan Inc\\'s Flipstart wasn\\'t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top.\\n \\n How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)? What about radios and TVs?\\n \\n The swiss army knife. By far the most useful gadget. I got mine 12 years ago. Still wearing and using it a lot! It stood the test of time.\\n \\n Psion Organiser series 3, should be up there. Had a usable qwerty keyboard, removable storage, good set of apps and programmable. Case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first, I think). Great product innovation.\\n \\n The first mobile PC was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile PC?! Why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site? It\\'s obviously the mobile phone or remote control, and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.\\n \\n The Motorola Startac should be Number One. Why? There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.\\n \\n The Psion series 3c! The first most practical way to carry all your info around...\\n \\n I too would back the Sinclair Spectrum - without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now.\\n \\n I\\'d have put the mobile phone high up the list. Probably a Nokia model.\\n \\n Sinclair Spectrum - 16k. It plugged into the tv. Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that\\'s what I do for a living now.\\n \\n I wish more modern notebooks -- even Apple\\'s newest offerings -- were more like the PB100. Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball, which has given way to the largely useless \"trackpad\" which every notebook on the market today uses. They\\'re invariably inaccurate, uncomfortable, and cumbersome to use.\\n \\n Congratulations to Apple, a deserved win!\\n'\n"," 'Concerns over Windows ATMs\\n \\n Cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses, a security firm has warned.\\n \\n The warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the Windows operating system in machines. Already there have been four incidents in which Windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the Microsoft operating system. But banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small.\\n \\n For many years the venerable IBM operating system, known as OS/2, has been the staple software used to power many of the 1.4m cash machines in operation around the world. But IBM will end support for OS/2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives. There are also other pressures making banks turn to Windows said Dominic Hirsch, managing director of financial analysis firm Retail Banking Research.\\n \\n He said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new Europay, Mastercard and Visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data. US laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways. Todd Thiemann, spokesman for anti-virus firm Trend Micro, said the move to Windows in cash machines was not without risks. Mr Thiemann said research by the TowerGroup showed that 70% of new cash machines being installed were Windows based.\\n \\n Already, he said, there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them.\\n \\n In January 2003 the Slammer worm knocked out 13,000 cash machines of the Bank of America and many of those operated by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. In August of the same year, cash machines of two un-named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the Welchia worm. Incidents like this happen, said Mr Thiemann, because when banks start using Windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers. This often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network. \"This could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system,\" he said. \"Banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network,\" Mr Thiemann told BBC News Online.\\n \\n But Mr Hirsch from Retail Banking Research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year.\\n \\n Currently, he said, a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10% of all ATMs get swapped for a newer model every year. \"Windows cash machines have been around for several years,\" he said. \"Most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle.\" \"In theory there is a bigger threat with Windows than OS/2,\" he said, \"but I do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment.\" \"It\\'s pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with ATMs,\" he said. The many different security systems built-in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously, he said. Banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all, he added. A spokesman for the Association of Payment and Clearing Services (Apacs) which represents the UK\\'s payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal. \"There\\'s no concern that there\\'s going to be any type of virus hitting the UK networks,\" he said. Risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect UK cash machines together and the operators of the ATMs themselves were a much smaller and tightly-knit community than in the US where viruses have struck.\\n'\n"," 'Sony PSP console hits US in March\\n \\n US gamers will be able to buy Sony\\'s PlayStation Portable from 24 March, but there is no news of a Europe debut.\\n \\n The handheld console will go on sale for $250 (Â£132) and the first million sold will come with Spider-Man 2 on UMD, the disc format for the machine. Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan. The console (12cm by 7.4cm) will play games, movies and music and also offers support for wireless gaming. Sony is entering a market which has been dominated by Nintendo for many years.\\n \\n It launched its DS handheld in Japan and the US last year and has sold 2.8 million units. Sony has said it wanted to launch the PSP in Europe at roughly the same time as the US, but gamers will now fear that the launch has been put back. Nintendo has said it will release the DS in Europe from 11 March. \"It has gaming at its core, but it\\'s not a gaming device. It\\'s an entertainment device,\" said Kaz Hirai, president of Sony Computer Entertainment America.\\n'\n"," 'Digital UK driven by net and TV\\n \\n The UK\\'s adoption of digital TV and broadband has helped make it the fourth most digitally-savvy nation in Europe, according a report by Jupiter Research.\\n \\n But the UK still lags in terms of broadband speeds compared to others. The most digitally sophisticated Europeans, in terms of use of digital goods such as mobiles, TV, net and cameras, are the Scandinavians. About 14 million households in the UK, 60%, have digital TV, according to the communications regulator Ofcom. The least digital of the European nations was Greece, in 17th position, according to the Digital Life Index.\\n \\n Scandinavian countries Sweden, Denmark and Norway came out top in the report, but there were some differences in technology trends. \"The European Digital Life Index demonstrates that digital lifestyles are common today, but across Europe there is no single digital lifestyle,\" said Nate Elliott, Jupiter analyst. \"Consumers adopt different digital products and services in different countries.\"\\n \\n Although there are differences between different European nations, the gap between them is closing, the report concluded. The trend for gadgets and technologies, such as digital video recorders (DVR), broadband, and video-on-demand will continue across Europe, he added. More than six million UK households now have broadband net. By the middle of 2005, it is estimated that 50% of all UK net users will be on broadband. Cable company NTL is trialling faster ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) broadband technology using ADSL2+ which can give speeds of 18Mbps compared to current speeds which are usually around 1Mbps or 2Mbps. BT is set to trial the technology later in the year. Super-fast broadband will be necessary to the delivery of services such as high-definition TV (HDTV) and video-on-demand, already very popular in France and other European countries.\\n \\n A separate survey by GMIPoll last week found that, globally, people\\'s appetite for technology and gadgets continues unabated. The poll of 20,000 people in 20 countries found that 59% wanted more technology.\\n \\n The computer was the \"must-have\" gadget for most people (75%). The TV took second place (67%), while the mobile was ranked in third position with 54%. Digital cameras were the most popular choice of gadget for 2005, said the survey, with nearly 40% choosing this over wireless, home printing and DVR technologies. However, only 25% of Britons said a digital camera would be their top gadget purchase of the year. Almost a quarter, 22%, said they would be buying some sort of wireless device. Forty-four percent said they would be buying something \"other\". This might include digital music players, or gaming devices. The Nintendo DS, Sony\\'s PSP and Gizmondo all hit the shops in 2005, and the first of the next generation of games consoles, Xbox 2, is set to launch later this year. Jupiter Research\\'s index is calculated using 40 different variables across net users, digital TV adoption, wireless and mobile, online activity, and digital devices.\\n']\n","*****************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CLUSTER 4\n","['Glazer makes new Man Utd approach\\n \\n Malcolm Glazer has made a fresh approach to buy Manchester United, which could lead to a bid valuing the Premiership club at Â£800m.\\n \\n The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with \"detailed proposals\", it has confirmed. Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. His new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt. Mr Glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the Red Devils and responded by using his 28.1% shareholding to vote off three board members last November.\\n \\n Man United had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. But newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid. Last week, however, Mr Glazer issued a statement to the Stock Exchange distancing himself from a new bid.\\n \\n Meanwhile, United\\'s chief executive David Gill said in December that talks would not resume unless Glazer came up with \"definitive proposals\". Now the board has confirmed that the US bidder is back, with a statement issued on Sunday reading: \"The board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer. \"A further announcement will be made in due course.\"\\n \\n To succeed Malcolm Glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who own 28.9% of the club. But the Irish duo have cut off talks with Glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach. United fans have reacted with anger at the announcement. They have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by Glazer since he first showed interest in the club in September 2003 and after Sunday\\'s announcement they vowed to fight on. \"We will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says. We do not want him or anybody else taking over United,\" said Mark Longden of the Independent Manchester United Supporters\\' Association. \"The campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since Glazer first showed interest in the club.\"\\n'\n"," 'Germany calls for EU reform\\n \\n German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called for radical reform of the EU\\'s stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits.\\n \\n Mr Schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3% limit if they met certain criteria. Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms. Changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in March.\\n \\n The current EU rules limit the size of a eurozone country\\'s deficit to 3% of GDP. Countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the European Commission, although several countries, including Germany, have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment. The European Commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules.\\n \\n Mr Schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions. \"The stability pact will work better if intervention by European institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions,\" he wrote. \"Only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the EU.\"\\n \\n Deficits should be allowed to rise above 3%, Mr Schroeder argued, if countries meet several \"mandatory criteria\". These include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms, countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering \"special economic burdens\". The proposed changes would make it harder for the European Commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact\\'s rules. Mr Schroeder\\'s intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 Eurozone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the pact. The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday\\'s Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members. Mr Schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact. A number of EU finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone\\'s rules.\\n'\n"," 'McDonald\\'s boss Bell dies aged 44\\n \\n Charlie Bell, the straight-talking former head of fast-food giant McDonald\\'s, has died of cancer aged 44.\\n \\n Mr Bell was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in May last year, a month after taking over the top job. He resigned in November to fight the illness. Joining the company as a 15-year-old part-time worker, Mr Bell quickly moved through its ranks, becoming Australia\\'s youngest store manager at 19. A popular go-getter, he is credited with helping revive McDonald\\'s sales. Mr Bell leaves a wife and daughter. \"As we mourn his passing, I ask you to keep Charlie\\'s family in your hearts and prayers,\" chief executive James Skinner said in a statement. \"And remember that in his abbreviated time on this earth, Charlie lived life to the fullest.\" \"No matter what cards life dealt, Charlie stayed centred on his love for his family and for McDonald\\'s.\"\\n \\n After running the company\\'s Australian business in the 1990s, Mr Bell moved to the US in 1999 to run operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In 2001, he took over the reins in Europe, McDonald\\'s second most important market. He became chief operating officer and president in 2002. Mr Bell took over as chief executive after his predecessor as CEO, Jim Cantalupo, died suddenly of a heart attack in April. Having worked closely with Mr Cantalupo, who came out of retirement to turn McDonald\\'s around, Mr Bell focused on boosting demand at existing restaurants rather than follow a policy of rapid expansion. He had promised not to let the company get \"fat, dumb and happy,\" and, according to Reuters, once told analysts that he would shove a fire hose down the throat of competitors if he saw them drowning. Mr Bell oversaw McDonald\\'s \"I\\'m lovin\\' it\" advertising campaign and introduced successes such as McCafe, now the biggest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand. Colleagues said that Mr Bell was proud of his humble beginnings, helping out behind cash tills and clearing tables when visiting restaurants.\\n'\n"," 'Circuit City gets takeover offer\\n \\n Circuit City Stores, the second-largest electronics retailer in the US, has received a $3.25bn (Â£1.7bn) takeover offer.\\n \\n The bid has come from Boston-based private investment firm Highfields Capital Management, which already owns 6.7% of Circuit City\\'s shares. Shares in the retailer were up 19.6% at $17.04 in Tuesday morning trading in New York following the announcement. Highfield said that it intends to take the Virginia-based firm private.\\n \\n \"Such a transformation would eliminate the public-company transparency into the company\\'s operating strategy that is uniquely damaging in a highly competitive industry where Circuit City is going head-to-head with a tough and entrenched rival,\" Highfield said. One analyst suggested that a bidding battle may now begin for the company. Bill Armstrong, a retail analyst at CL King & Associates, said he expected to see other private investment firms come forward for Circuit City. The retailer is debt free with a good cash flow, despite the fact that it is said to be struggling to keep up with market leader Best Buy and cut-price competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, said Mr Armstrong.\\n'\n"," 'Bank opts to leave rates on hold\\n \\n The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\\n \\n The Bank\\'s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month\\'s economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week\\'s inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\\n \\n Slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\\n \\n And recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\\n \\n Business groups welcomed the MPC\\'s widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"\\n']\n","*****************************************************************\n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["# for each cluster, printing the 5 random news articles\n","for i in range(5):\n","    print(\"CLUSTER\",i)\n","    print(clustered_data.loc[clustered_data.Category == i, 'Text'].sample(5, random_state=1).values)\n","    print(\"*****************************************************************\")\n","    print(\"\\n\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":100,"status":"ok","timestamp":1756794349704,"user":{"displayName":"Boogeyman","userId":"04170040929750470005"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"q27l6g7pGjQ3","outputId":"c83fd2ad-36f9-43fd-a6b1-792b99c0a68c"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"summary":"{\n  \"name\": \"clustered_data\",\n  \"rows\": 2225,\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2127,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Blair congratulates Bush on win\\n \\n Tony Blair has said he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with George Bush and working with him during his second term as president.\\n \\n Mr Bush's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was \\\"fractured, divided and uncertain\\\", Mr Blair said. It had to be brought together, he added, saying action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey. Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.\\n \\n But there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by \\\"military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values\\\" he added. Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most \\\"pressing political challenge\\\" of the present day, Mr Blair warned. The prime minister also urged Europe and the US to \\\"build anew their alliance\\\".\\n \\n \\\"All of us in positions of leadership, not just President Bush, have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. It is urgent that we do so.\\\" Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election \\\"a true celebration of American democracy\\\". The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added. Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his \\\"warmest congratulations\\\", saying: \\\"We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom.\\\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000.\\n \\n Mr Bush's first task was to \\\"rebuild a sense of domestic purpose\\\" within the US, he said. Mr Kennedy said: \\\"Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism.\\\" Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an \\\"umbilical cord\\\" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.\\n \\n \\\"Europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character, and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security. \\\"Iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come.\\\" Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.\\n \\n Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday. Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite George Bush's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. Public opinion would force change, she told BBC news. But Myron Ebell, an adviser on climate change to President Bush, has said there would be no change in the US stance and rejected the threat of climate change. He claimed the US was the only country with independent scientists.\\n\",\n          \"China Aviation seeks rescue deal\\n \\n Scandal-hit jet fuel supplier China Aviation Oil has offered to repay its creditors $220m (\\u00c2\\u00a3117m) of the $550m it lost on trading in oil futures.\\n \\n The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years. With assets of $200m and liabilities totalling $648m, it needs creditors' backing for the offer to avoid going into bankruptcy. The trading scandal is the biggest to hit Singapore since the $1.2bn collapse of Barings Bank in 1995. Chen Jiulin, chief executive of China Aviation Oil (CAO), was arrested by at Changi Airport by Singapore police on 8 December. He was returning from China, where he had headed when CAO announced its trading debacle in late-November. The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead.\\n \\n Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy. Of the immediate payment, the firm - China's biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $30m out of its own resources. The rest would come from its parent company, China Aviation Oil Holding Company in Beijing. The holding company, owned by the Chinese government, holds most of CAO's Singapore-listed shares. It cut its holding from 75% to 60% on 20 October.\\n\",\n          \"Yukos heading back to US courts\\n \\n Russian oil and gas company Yukos is due in a US court on Thursday as it continues to fight for its survival.\\n \\n The firm is in the process of being broken up by Russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (\\u00c2\\u00a314bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, Yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm Rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted.\\n \\n Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated US bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means. The company wants damages of $20bn, claiming Yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. Judge Letitia Clark will hear different motions, including one from Deutsche Bank to throw out the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The German lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for Yuganskneftegas. Deutsche Bank, which is also an advisor to Gazprom, has called on the US court to overturn its decision to provide Yukos with bankruptcy protection.\\n \\n Lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify Deutsche Bank's business position, analysts said.\\n \\n Analysts are not optimistic about Yukos' chances in court. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country's legal authorities have repeatedly said that the US has no jurisdiction over Yukos and its legal wranglings. On top of that, the firm only has limited assets in the US. Yukos has won small victories, however, and is bullish about its chances in court. \\\"Do we have an ability to influence what happens? We think we do,\\\" said Mike Lake, a Yukos spokesman. \\\"The litigation risks are real,\\\" said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Vadim Mitroshin The dispute with the Russian authorities is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Sports\",\n          \"Entertainment\",\n          \"Business\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"clustered_data"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-183d7120-e5d8-4e2c-b162-099fdbea60d8\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Text</th>\n","      <th>Category</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Budget to set scene for election\\n \\n Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\\n \\n Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about Â£2bn to spare.\\n \\n - Increase in the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000 \\n  - A freeze on petrol duty \\n  - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \\n  - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than Â£60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to Â£150,000 in February.\\n \\n The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around Â£10bn.\"\\n \\n But Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a Â£35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\\n \\n For the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a Â£2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to Â£5.60 an hour.\\n</td>\n","      <td>Politics</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Army chiefs in regiments decision\\n \\n Military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland's Army regiments.\\n \\n A committee of the Army Board, which is made up of the most senior defence figures, will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on Monday. The proposals include cutting Scotland's six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment. The plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. The committee's decision must be ratified by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Prime Minister Tony Blair. It is expected that it will be made public next week. When ministers announced a reorganisation of the Army it drew a question mark over the futures of the Black Watch, the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In October, the Council of Scottish Colonels proposed the merger of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers into a single battalion.\\n \\n Under their vision, it would be one of five in the new super regiment. The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with Labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan. They felt the timing was insensitive because the Black Watch was in the frontline in Iraq, suffering casualties. The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election.\\n \\n Speaking ahead of the expected Army Board meeting, a spokesman said: \"The government and the Army Board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the Scottish regiments are for the good of the Army and for that of the serving soldier. \"They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotland's regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world.\" An alternative blueprint had been put forward by Labour MP Eric Joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely. Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely. He said: \"They don't want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it, all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly.\" The prime minister said he hoped campaigners' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.\\n</td>\n","      <td>Politics</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Howard denies split over ID cards\\n \\n Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.\\n \\n The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a \"collective view\" after holding a \"good discussion\", but admitted it was \"not an easy issue\". He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\\n \\n Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n \\n He acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\\n \\n Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n \\n They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and \"deeply flawed\". He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.\"\\n \\n The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a \"regressive\" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britain's ethnic minorities being stopped by police.\\n</td>\n","      <td>Politics</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Observers to monitor UK election\\n \\n Ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming UK general election is fairly run.\\n \\n The move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. A report by two MPs committees called on Thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election.\\n \\n Junior constitutional affairs minister Christopher Leslie said: \"I fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced.\" The government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.\\n \\n But trial all-postal ballots in four English regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges \"on a scale not seen since the 19th Century\". Thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). It said that, with the growth of postal voting, there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually, rather than by household. It also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.\\n \\n Figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. Young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could \"dramatically reduce the chances of fraud\". But his counterpart on the DCA committee, Alan Beith, said it should be delayed \"until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective.\" Shadow Constitutional Affairs Secretary Oliver Heald accused the government of \"dragging its feet\" over \"this badly needed measure\". \"It is vital that we move ahead with the Northern Ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the Britain's electoral system,\" he said.\\n \\n The report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in Northern Ireland when it was introduced in 2002. The report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. It said incentives to register, such as Â£20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as \"gimmicks\" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said. Instead they called for \"imaginative campaigns\" to boost interest.\\n</td>\n","      <td>Politics</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Kilroy names election seat target\\n \\n Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\\n \\n Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\\n \\n On Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\\n \\n UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\\n \\n UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said.

He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\\n \\n Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about Â£2bn to spare.\\n \\n - Increase in the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000 \\n  - A freeze on petrol duty \\n  - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \\n  - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than Â£60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to Â£150,000 in February.\\n \\n The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around Â£10bn.\"\\n \\n But Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a Â£35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\\n \\n For the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a Â£2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to Â£5.60 an hour.\\n   \n","1                                                                                                                                                     Army chiefs in regiments decision\\n \\n Military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland's Army regiments.\\n \\n A committee of the Army Board, which is made up of the most senior defence figures, will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on Monday. The proposals include cutting Scotland's six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment. The plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. The committee's decision must be ratified by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Prime Minister Tony Blair. It is expected that it will be made public next week. When ministers announced a reorganisation of the Army it drew a question mark over the futures of the Black Watch, the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In October, the Council of Scottish Colonels proposed the merger of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers into a single battalion.\\n \\n Under their vision, it would be one of five in the new super regiment. The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with Labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan. They felt the timing was insensitive because the Black Watch was in the frontline in Iraq, suffering casualties. The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election.\\n \\n Speaking ahead of the expected Army Board meeting, a spokesman said: \"The government and the Army Board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the Scottish regiments are for the good of the Army and for that of the serving soldier. \"They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotland's regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world.\" An alternative blueprint had been put forward by Labour MP Eric Joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely. Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely. He said: \"They don't want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it, all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly.\" The prime minister said he hoped campaigners' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.\\n   \n","2  Howard denies split over ID cards\\n \\n Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.\\n \\n The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a \"collective view\" after holding a \"good discussion\", but admitted it was \"not an easy issue\". He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\\n \\n Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n \\n He acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\\n \\n Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n \\n They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and \"deeply flawed\". He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.\"\\n \\n The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a \"regressive\" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britain's ethnic minorities being stopped by police.\\n   \n","3                                                                             Observers to monitor UK election\\n \\n Ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming UK general election is fairly run.\\n \\n The move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. A report by two MPs committees called on Thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election.\\n \\n Junior constitutional affairs minister Christopher Leslie said: \"I fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced.\" The government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.\\n \\n But trial all-postal ballots in four English regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges \"on a scale not seen since the 19th Century\". Thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). It said that, with the growth of postal voting, there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually, rather than by household. It also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.\\n \\n Figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. Young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could \"dramatically reduce the chances of fraud\". But his counterpart on the DCA committee, Alan Beith, said it should be delayed \"until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective.\" Shadow Constitutional Affairs Secretary Oliver Heald accused the government of \"dragging its feet\" over \"this badly needed measure\". \"It is vital that we move ahead with the Northern Ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the Britain's electoral system,\" he said.\\n \\n The report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in Northern Ireland when it was introduced in 2002. The report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. It said incentives to register, such as Â£20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as \"gimmicks\" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said. Instead they called for \"imaginative campaigns\" to boost interest.\\n   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Kilroy names election seat target\\n \\n Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\\n \\n Labour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\\n \\n On Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\\n \\n UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\\n \\n UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\\n   \n","\n","   Category  \n","0  Politics  \n","1  Politics  \n","2
